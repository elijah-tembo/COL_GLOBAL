/*What	just	happened?
We	set	up	a	navigation	menu	that	consists	of	a	set	of	nested	lists,	forming	a	hierarchy.
Next,	we	attached	a	CSS	file	to	add	simple	drop-down	functionality	to	our	menu.
However,	this	CSS-only	menu	had	a	few	shortcomings.	So	we	attached	the	Superfish
plugin	to	take	care	of	those	and	make	our	menu	more	user	friendly.*/
